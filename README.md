# Transfer-Learning-A-way-for-Ear-Biometric-Recognition

**Aim:** Using Transfer Learning for ear biometric detection
**Steps**
* Reading dataset and performing label encoding on the labels
* One hot encoding the labels
* splitting the dataset into training and testing
* Model development and training
  * Convolutional Neural Network
  * VGG16
  * ResNet50
* Evaluating the models
  * Accuracy
  * Loss
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * Sensitivity
  * F1 score
  * Confusion Matrix
* Selecting best model

**Conclusion**
* Ear biometrics povides contact free identification method
* Uses IIT Delhi ear dataset
* VGG16 is best performing model
* Study can be taken ahead by using AlexNet, DenseNet, and GooLeNet
* GAN and Autoencoders can be used for augmenting the dataset for better performance
